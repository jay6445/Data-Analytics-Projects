But, I\\'ll request you to go through all the repairs which Aman mentioned, and if you could provide us with pillow, bedsheets and curtains, it will be highly appreciated. Thanks!!\\n15/09/20, 9:26 am - Siobhan: Hi all\\nWe must receive the rent, deposit and contracts today as at present there is no agreement in place. \\nAs advised in my previous message regarding bedding on 9th September at 9.28pm that you would need to all supply your own bedding \\nThis would be necessary with Covid-19. \\nAs advised Penneys store is very reasonable and I shared links to Penneys and Guineys via WhatsApp yesterday for Aman. These shops provide all bedding needs\\nWith regards to curtains \\nWe replaced the curtains last week with new blinds instead which are more hygienic than curtains especially at the present time and also make the room more spacious feeling. \\nThe blinds are put up and down depending on whether you want the room dark or bright and provides the same function as the curtains. \\nWith regards to the WiFi it was connected and working yesterday afternoon\\nThe patio door is working The lock replaced at the weekend by a tradesperson on Saturday. \\nThis allows for the door to be locked from the inside without a key \\nThe knob will be a bit stiff as it is new. \\nWith regards to the tap. \\nThe tap is functioning correctly it is a cover that is missing. This is not required to be replaced and will be documented in our records that this was missing on your commencement of your lease. \\nWith regards to the shelf there are 3 little clips required to slide in the shelf it is not a safety issue and not effecting the functionality of the wardrobe. I will be easily fixed by a tradesperson\\n\\n\\n With regards to the window it is a specific tradesperson who will deal with the crack and assess the best management of it. \\nAt this point the window is secure and the glazier will deal with it. \\nThe desk that the glass is missing I give you authority to put it in the dump as it is not functional. \\n\\nThe heating is working \\nAll the above have been recorded as being present when you arrived and not as a result of your occupation\\nWe always require the deposit and the contracts to secure the property we understoodyour predicament and we were fair to hold the property and allow our address to be used without the agreement in place. The lease commenced yesterday yet when Aman was landing a day early and I was concerned about him trying to find the apartment and get used of the place at night we paid for his accommodation and breakfast so that he would arrive in daylight and get chance to organise shopping, bedding etc. \\nThe contract has gone in advance and I have answered any queries. \\nI will need the contracts back, the deposit and\\nRent as the tenancy started yesterday and nobody can be staying in the property without a contract and deposit and rent paid. I understand that the bank transfer can take a few days so a snap shot of the transaction will suffice and I will confirm receipt of it when it arrives \\nKind regards Siobhan\\n15/09/20, 9:29 am - Siobhan: Spring operated roller blinds rely on a spring tensioned clutch mechanism to hold the fabric in the desired position. The blind is lowered by pulling on a centrally fixed cord at the side of the window .

Is the window closed fully? \\nThere are vents also on the window\\nThey are required to assist with ventilation which is very important in Ireland due to our damp weather in if too much heat or not enough heat is used along with the condensation we get then dampness occurs.\\nYou will sometimes find condensation(wet) on glass inside bedroom windows in winter\\nThis is totally normal here it is due to our climate\\nIt is important to open windows daily for a little while to allow the exchange of the air in our climate throughout the year otherwise it results in dampness\\nThe blinds are also a form of heat control for us as when closed they are a form of insulation\\nWhen investing in bedding the duvets (quilts) come in a thing called togs the higher the tog the warmer they are.\\n20/09/20, 7:20 pm - Siobhan: https://images.app.goo.gl/KEvtgFgg4qCg6FZR9\\n20/09/20, 7:34 pm - Siobhan: The above explains duvet togs\\nUsually in our house I use @9 tog from @ mid March to end of October\\nThen I use a @ 13tog duvet for the winter. If the weather is very cold I use both together. \\nWe also use fleece blankets / throws both on the bed in winter and also over us watching TV in winter as it can be cold. I feel the cold even though I have lived here all my life. The weather here really never gets awfully warm and the duvet is used most of the summer unless on a very rare warm night and a sheet may be enough. To be honest I can\\'t remember it being that hot for a few summers. \\nThe temperature never really gets really hot or extremely cold in comparison to other countries. \\nSnow fall is usually very light it may last a week or so or some winter we have none. The  same today was a roasting day in Ireland the early 20s is hot here.\\nFrom March onwards until mid October usually we would not use any form of heating. The heating usage increase and December and January is usually the coldest.\\nI will send you on pictures of what I talk about so it will be easier than my description\\n20/09/20, 7:37 pm - Siobhan: https://www.dunnesstores.com/p/fleece-throw/7562770\\n20/09/20, 7:37 pm - Siobhan: The above is an example of the fleece throws they are lovely and soft\\n20/09/20, 7:38 pm - Siobhan: https://www.dunnesstores.com/c/home/bathroom/bath-mats\\n20/09/20, 7:40 pm - Siobhan: The above are bath mats\\nYou place them outside your bath or shower and you stand on the when you are drying your self\\nSo that you are not standing on the wet floor they also soak up some water from Bath or shower\\n20/09/20, 7:42 pm - Siobhan: https://www.ebay.ie/b/Fleece-Bed-Blankets-with-Sleeves/175750/bn_7030239954\\n20/09/20, 7:47 pm - Siobhan: Warmies Light Brown Owl, 820 g https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0087D6VNC/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_i_io6zFb9C8GC55\\n20/09/20, 7:50 pm - Siobhan: This will contain a beanbag you put in the beanbag to the microwave for the correct time then put it inside the owl as the beanbag is really hot\\nYou put in the bed\\n\\nThere are also things called hot water bottles\\nThey are rubber and you fill them with hot water and place them in the bed and put the bedclothes over it\\n\\nBefore you get into bed you take the hot water bottle out of the bed incase it would leak or burst and cause burns\\n20/09/20, 7:56 pm - Siobhan: Penneys is usually the cheapest with clothes they sell fleece pyjamas and onesies and fleece socks.\\nThey also sell duvets warmers etc\\nIt is very popular in Ireland and it is known as Primark in the UK \\nThey sell lots of modern clothes very cheap \\nDunnes stores is usually a little dearer but the quality is usually better \\nGuineys also good for bedding \\nEven with heat on it can be cold at night. \\nBecause of the coast it keeps things cooler\\n20/09/20, 8:10 pm - Mayur: Thanks Siobhan for the guidelines.
