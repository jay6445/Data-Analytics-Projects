25/08/20, 7:24 am - Siobhan: All landlords in Ireland are required to register unless they live in the property with the tenants ie are renting out a room only
25/08/20, 7:25 am - Siobhan: New tenants are not registered until they move in to the property
25/08/20, 7:29 am - Siobhan: I can do up the lease document for you all to review

25/08/20, 7:41 am - Jay: Thank you that'll be reassuring üòÖ
25/08/20, 7:42 am - Shankare: That's perfect!! Thank you so much
25/08/20, 7:44 am - Siobhan: No problem at all
It is very hard for you all to be dealing with someone so far away when organising such important things
25/08/20, 7:48 am - Shankare: Yes.. Exactly we were bombarded with whole lot things.. Thank you so much for understanding and being patient with me from the beginning.. üòÖ
25/08/20, 7:51 am - Siobhan: It is so hard to get organised this year especially
Even within Ireland with trying to keep everyone safe.

27/08/20, 4:33 pm - Siobhan: Thank you
27/08/20, 4:34 pm - Mayur: Hey Siobhan, can we know what kind of stoves are present in the kitchen? Is it the Induction one or the gas one?
27/08/20, 4:35 pm - Siobhan: Induction ceramic hob
Then there is an oven for baking
27/08/20, 4:36 pm - Mayur: Okay. So I guess we will need to bring flat based utensils with us.
27/08/20, 4:37 pm - Siobhan: https://www.buyitdirect.ie/p/indesit-ti60x-60cm-four-zone-solid-plate-electic-hob-stainless-steel-ti60x?refsource=bidieadwords&mkwid=s3pnpVUFs_dm&pcrid=291254296687&product=TI60X&pgrid=58589343756&ptaid=pla-477340086644&channel=googlesearch&gclid=Cj0KCQjws536BRDTARIsANeUZ58SLxqDxk0ovLsZ-a0wP4dvbjQiYbJKu13Gjcs1llGzKXOHsjg7l_kaAh-iEALw_wcB
It looks like this
27/08/20, 4:37 pm - Mayur: Okay, thanks :)
27/08/20, 4:38 pm - Siobhan: There was some utensils there when the guys moved in so I assume they should be OK
27/08/20, 4:38 pm - Mayur: Alright
27/08/20, 4:39 pm - Siobhan: https://www.buyitdirect.ie/p/indesit-ifw6230whuk-four-function-electric-built-in-single-oven-white-ifw6230whuk?refsource=bidieadwords&mkwid=sanw99M2j_dm&pcrid=291209596470&product=IFW6230WHUK&pgrid=65405135984&ptaid=pla-448870471153&channel=googlesearch&gclid=Cj0KCQjws536BRDTARIsANeUZ58CZi3FTKpDBeiGDpTr80QNjmqZtZcE5muG9ojG9GlRWcFGi96docsaAhbZEALw_wcB
Oven would be similar to this
28/08/20, 5:57 am - Shankare: My full name is Shankare Muthukumar Shiva
E-mail- Shankare.shankz@gmail.com
28/08/20, 5:58 am - Meena: My full name is Meena Loganathan
Email - meenzinbox@gmail.com
28/08/20, 6:52 am - Siobhan: Thank you
What date would contract start for move in date and is it until end of August 2021?
29/08/20, 12:36 am - Siobhan: <Media omitted>
29/08/20, 12:37 am - Siobhan: I just put in provisional dates
29/08/20, 5:18 am - Mayur: Hi Siobhan, could you please provide us a video or pictures of the apartment we're going to be in? 
Because we have a few pictures and a video but the apartment is different in both! üòÖ
Thanks
29/08/20, 5:26 am - Shankare: Thank you Siobhan
29/08/20, 6:56 am - Jay: Hi Siobhan,
We would prefer a 6 month contract first. Can you provide us pictures/video of the apartment we are moving in. Also I came across a website for Edenhall, just wanted to know if you guys do it through that or individually. Thanks for the document, we will go through it and get back with questions üòÑ
29/08/20, 7:21 am - Meena: Thank you siobhan
29/08/20, 9:44 am - Siobhan: This is the apartment
29/08/20, 9:47 am - Siobhan: No we do not operate on the website
The website is operated by the management company who deal with large numbers of apartments
The minimum length of the lease would be 9 months
29/08/20, 9:49 am - Siobhan: <Media omitted>
29/08/20, 10:18 am - Siobhan: All apartments are very similar so any photos on website would be similar to ours
With the management company you don't rent an apartment you rent a an individual and they allocate each person into an apartment as far as I'm aware The allocation placement in the apartment may be with people who don't know each other 
We self manage
We always rent it as a full apartment so the people know each other and hopefully enjoy each others company 
With the management company you pay your rent in 2 installments instead of monthly 
Each person pays for a lump sum upfront for electricity where we have pre pay power meters so you top it up as required
We pay fees for the cost of security, waste disposal, WiFi, maintenance of the common areas
Problems that may arise where for example a key card was causing the reception office 
It problem was with anything inside the apartment we would deal with the repairs
With the website you deal with the management company and not the owner 
I hope I have explained this ok
29/08/20, 1:37 pm - Mayur: Thanks Siobhan for this info. üòá
29/08/20, 6:08 pm - Shankare added Shaival
30/08/20, 10:49 am - Shaival: Hello, Patrick. Hope you're doing well. My name is Shaival Mehta, I'll be joining University College Cork for Msc in Business Information and Analytical Systems. I'll be arriving in Cork around 20th September. Your house is beautiful. Cheersüòá
30/08/20, 12:25 pm - Siobhan: Thank you Shaival
30/08/20, 1:04 pm - Jay: Thank you for the clear explanation Siobhan. I read the contract and have a couple of questions/corrections 1. My name should be "Jayesh Prakash Rao". 2. What is TV Licence fee? 3. Can we have the lease for 9 months first as mentioned by you?
30/08/20, 2:20 pm - Siobhan: Hi Jayesh
I will amend your name 
The TV licence is an annual fee of @ 150 euro for having a tv
It is not necessary to get it unless it is required and I can then sort it out for ye
I will do a 9 month contract 
What date do you want it to commence?
30/08/20, 2:43 pm - Siobhan: The date of the 1st person's arrival
03/09/20, 7:50 am - Shankare added Aman

03/09/20, 8:23 am - Jay: You deleted this message

We collectively decided that once Aman reaches there and moves in we will all make the payments from our side, we request you to allow for the same.

10/09/20, 11:00 am - Siobhan: <Media omitted>
10/09/20, 11:01 am - Siobhan: Hi all this is the bank account details for deposit and rent
The deposit and rent is to be paid from 1 account in 1 full amount
Kind regards Siobhan
10/09/20, 11:18 am - Meena: This message was deleted
10/09/20, 11:21 am - Meena: Sure siobhan. Can u also kindly clarify on the rent part because it is mentioned in the agreement as.."Rent which is less than one month will be calculated on pro rata". Thank you for your patience! üòä
10/09/20, 12:10 pm - Siobhan: That is where a group is moving in example 3rd October until 25th June
The amount of rent from 3rd June to 25th June would not be a full month so it would be calculated as the rate per day x the amount of days

Monthly rent ‚Ç¨30

Rent per day
‚Ç¨1
22 days x ‚Ç¨1= ‚Ç¨22
10/09/20, 12:33 pm - Meena: Thank you siobhan for the clarification! üòä

15/09/20, 8:38 am - Shaival: Hey Siobhan, we will sign the contract, and complete our process of deposit as well as rent too, asap. But, I'll request you to go through all the repairs which Aman mentioned, and if you could provide us with pillow, bedsheets and curtains, it will be highly appreciated. Thanks!!
15/09/20, 9:26 am - Siobhan: Hi all
We must receive the rent, deposit and contracts today as at present there is no agreement in place. 
As advised in my previous message regarding bedding on 9th September at 9.28pm that you would need to all supply your own bedding 
This would be necessary with Covid-19. 
As advised Penneys store is very reasonable and I shared links to Penneys and Guineys via WhatsApp yesterday for Aman. These shops provide all bedding needs
With regards to curtains 
We replaced the curtains last week with new blinds instead which are more hygienic than curtains especially at the present time and also make the room more spacious feeling. 
The blinds are put up and down depending on whether you want the room dark or bright and provides the same function as the curtains. 
With regards to the WiFi it was connected and working yesterday afternoon
The patio door is working The lock replaced at the weekend by a tradesperson on Saturday. 
This allows for the door to be locked from the inside without a key 
The knob will be a bit stiff as it is new. 
With regards to the tap. 
The tap is functioning correctly it is a cover that is missing. This is not required to be replaced and will be documented in our records that this was missing on your commencement of your lease. 
With regards to the shelf there are 3 little clips required to slide in the shelf it is not a safety issue and not effecting the functionality of the wardrobe. I will be easily fixed by a tradesperson


 With regards to the window it is a specific tradesperson who will deal with the crack and assess the best management of it. 
At this point the window is secure and the glazier will deal with it. 
The desk that the glass is missing I give you authority to put it in the dump as it is not functional. 

The heating is working 
All the above have been recorded as being present when you arrived and not as a result of your occupation
We always require the deposit and the contracts to secure the property we understoodyour predicament and we were fair to hold the property and allow our address to be used without the agreement in place. The lease commenced yesterday yet when Aman was landing a day early and I was concerned about him trying to find the apartment and get used of the place at night we paid for his accommodation and breakfast so that he would arrive in daylight and get chance to organise shopping, bedding etc. 
The contract has gone in advance and I have answered any queries. 
I will need the contracts back, the deposit and
Rent as the tenancy started yesterday and nobody can be staying in the property without a contract and deposit and rent paid. I understand that the bank transfer can take a few days so a snap shot of the transaction will suffice and I will confirm receipt of it when it arrives 
Kind regards Siobhan
15/09/20, 9:29 am - Siobhan: Spring operated roller blinds rely on a spring tensioned clutch mechanism to hold the fabric in the desired position. The blind is lowered by pulling on a centrally fixed cord at the side of the window . The blind is retracted by a gentle tug on the cord.
15/09/20, 9:32 am - Siobhan: https://images.app.goo.gl/PDLKuZjD63rciNPK6

15/09/20, 10:15 am - Mayur: Thanks Siobhan! We'll sort this out
15/09/20, 10:19 am - Siobhan: The blinds are usually better than curtains for darkness
15/09/20, 10:30 am - Shaival: Thank you Siobhan!!

15/09/20, 1:38 pm - Mayur: Hi Siobhan, I tried using transferwise to see if we can make a payment
15/09/20, 1:38 pm - Mayur: But I am getting an error like this
15/09/20, 1:39 pm - Mayur: <Media omitted>
15/09/20, 1:39 pm - Mayur: I put the IBAN number below where they had asked for it
15/09/20, 2:03 pm - Siobhan: Can your bank in India advise on transfer of funds to Ireland?
15/09/20, 2:54 pm - Shaival: Siobhan, we are trying through transferwise, but we are getting errors. Can you help us?
15/09/20, 3:05 pm - Jay: Hi Siobhan can you give me your address? My bank needs the beneficiary address.
15/09/20, 3:11 pm - Jay: Hi Siobhan, can we for just this one time transfer our respective amounts seperately as it is complicated to co ordinate with our different banks here. We will surely figure this out next month. Transfer will be much faster this way.
15/09/20, 3:11 pm - Shaival: Yeah very true

15/09/20, 5:18 pm - Mayur: Hi Siobhan
So for this month we're dividing the rent amongst the 5 of us which comes down to 221.86 per person.

The deposit is being shared by all the 6 of us which comes down to 346.66 per person.
15/09/20, 5:19 pm - Mayur: So the 5 of us except Gunjan would pay 568.52 while Gunjan would be only the deposit i.e. 346.66.
15/09/20, 5:21 pm - Mayur: Please verify the calculation once. üòá
15/09/20, 5:31 pm - Siobhan: The rent from the 14th September to 30th September is ‚Ç¨221.86 each for 5 persons correct
15/09/20, 5:33 pm - Siobhan: The deposit calculation of ‚Ç¨346.66x 6 people is correct
15/09/20, 5:35 pm - Siobhan: ‚Ç¨568.52 for 5 persons deposit and rent included
Gunjan ‚Ç¨346.66 deposit only correct
15/09/20, 5:36 pm - Siobhan: Other full calendar months ie 1st October to 31st October ‚Ç¨346.66 x6 persons rent only
15/09/20, 5:37 pm - Siobhan: Your calculations are correct
15/09/20, 5:44 pm - Mayur: Great!
15/09/20, 5:44 pm - Mayur: üòÄ
15/09/20, 6:11 pm - Gunjan (Griffith College): Yes thanksüëçüèªüòÄ
15/09/20, 7:05 pm - Meena: Hello Siobhan/Patrick. Gold evening.Hope you are doing well.  I am really sorry for the delay in payments. As we are new to international transfer payments procedure and bank ppl are also messing up with it, am trying to sort it out as soon as possible. I can understand,the mistake is from my side. Kindly excuse me for a day or two,so before I reach cork I wl make the payment of my deposit and rent. and I am traveling on 18th ..Apologies to the inconvenience caused.. thanks alot for your patience.
15/09/20, 7:13 pm - Mayur: <Media omitted>
15/09/20, 7:14 pm - Meena: This message was deleted
15/09/20, 7:16 pm - Mayur: Hello Patrick/Siobhan
I have initiated a transfer of 569 Euros from my end. The transaction should ideally be completed in 2 days. Sending the receipt.
Sorry for the delay caused, as Meena said the international transfer was a new thing for us and all the process differed from bank to bank. 
I assure you that others will also sort out the payment asap! üôÇ
15/09/20, 7:16 pm - Mayur: We would be getting a receipt of the deposit right? So that we can use it during the reimburesment?
15/09/20, 7:17 pm - Gunjan (Griffith College): Yes we will make it as early as possible, it is taking time to understand the process.
15/09/20, 7:18 pm - Siobhan: Thank you Mayur
15/09/20, 7:20 pm - Siobhan: Bank transfer can take a few days even between irish banks
If ye send the snap shot like Mayur then I can see it arriving
15/09/20, 7:20 pm - Meena: Sure, Siobhan we wl do it
15/09/20, 7:23 pm - Jay: Hi Siobhan, I have initiated the transfer of 568.52 Euro and I just got the message that it is processing, I'll keep you updated. Like Mayur mentioned thanks for being patient for everything is new for us. Also can you please provide a receipt for the rent+deposit so that I can keep for my record.
15/09/20, 7:27 pm - Siobhan: I will sent you all confirmation of the deposit
The grant thing with electronic transfer is that it provides both people with a record of all transactions
15/09/20, 7:36 pm - Jay: Cool üëç
15/09/20, 7:42 pm - Siobhan: It is so convenient for expenses we use it so much here even to sent some birthday gifts of money it just lands in the account and you just put a reference on it so that the person knows where the payment came from
15/09/20, 7:50 pm - Gunjan (Griffith College): We will learn too once we reach there and get into convient processüòÄ
15/09/20, 8:02 pm - Shaival: <Media omitted>
15/09/20, 8:05 pm - Shaival: Hey, Siobhan sorry for the delay. I'm still waiting for the approval. If it gets approved within an hour, I'll complete it today itself. Otherwise, I'll complete the payment in Morning surely. Sorry, and thanks for your cooperation.
15/09/20, 8:13 pm - Siobhan: That is absolutely fine

16/09/20, 7:40 am - Shaival: Okay!! Thanks Siobhan
16/09/20, 7:42 am - Jay: Cool üëç

I only require the 3 signed sheets back
If it is easier when everyone is in Cork then ye can confirm that ye have read and are happy to proceed with the contract

I just checked the account and the money has landed thank you
17/09/20, 8:52 pm - Meena: üòåüòå
19/09/20, 7:08 pm - Aman: Electric meter is making alarm
19/09/20, 7:10 pm - Aman: Premton came he saw everything and said you already know about the issues.
19/09/20, 7:10 pm - Aman: 1. Sliding door slider is not working. He said you know about it.
19/09/20, 7:12 pm - Aman: 2. Room 1&2 shower is not working. He said we need to get a new one, but you need to approve it first.
19/09/20, 7:12 pm - Aman: 3. Room 1- main door lock we need to install a new one as there is no lock on the door.
19/09/20, 7:14 pm - Aman: 4. Room 3 : window need to be replaced, Premtom told it will be difficult to sleep in that room because night it comes too cold.
19/09/20, 7:16 pm - Aman: That day you recharged it. But we need to again do it.
19/09/20, 7:18 pm - Aman: 5. Wifi we need to take one more repeater
19/09/20, 7:21 pm - Siobhan: Hi all I spoke to Premton
He is going doing the showers and door s
I have discussed with Premton that I have already contacted 3 window companies to arrange them to measure and fit the glass he said that he may be able to do the window also and will measure when he is back doing showers
19/09/20, 7:24 pm - Shaival: No just repeater, we need to update it. It is not working properly, very low speed, and I'm afraid this won't help in our online classes as well.
19/09/20, 7:24 pm - Shaival: Not*
19/09/20, 7:26 pm - Siobhan: If the wifi is not strong enough you just need to move the repeater to another room as that is what has been recommended as these are very specific repeaters different to what we use in the home. Each bedroom has the place to plug in. 
That is a new repeater we purchased on Monday
19/09/20, 7:30 pm - Siobhan: After pressing 111
19/09/20, 7:32 pm - Siobhan: This is the numbers you press to get the balance
I sent 2 codes earlier in the week for top up were both numbers inputted by Aman?
19/09/20, 7:33 pm - Siobhan: When you've topped up you will usually receive a 20 digit Powercode. Just input this into your Keypad:
Press* - Then enter your powercode - Then Press#

Don‚Äôt worry if you enter it wrong, just press * to go back and try again
19/09/20, 7:33 pm - Siobhan: Means this number then I need to press *
19/09/20, 7:33 pm - Siobhan: Then this number and then #
19/09/20, 7:36 pm - Jay: Hi Siobhan, repeater will only increase the range but the network speed will still remain the same. We are facing call drops since morning, can the speed be increased? It's just 16mbps when I last checked and if we all take online classes at the same time it'll be a hassle.
19/09/20, 7:37 pm - Siobhan: The two codes were sent to Aman
There should have been ample credit between both codes.
As I explained to Aman
you can top up at the shops that sell pre pay power you get a receipt and you type it in.
Once you get a sim card then you can get your own names and numbers on the account then ye download an app for pre pay power so u can top up and manage your account from your phone
19/09/20, 7:38 pm - Aman: 2931 1210 6011 6840 5525 insert this top up code
19/09/20, 7:38 pm - Aman: 33892 56349 25968 21289
19/09/20, 7:38 pm - Aman: I tried it
19/09/20, 7:39 pm - Aman: It's now not working
19/09/20, 7:39 pm - Aman: I don't know why
19/09/20, 7:46 pm - Siobhan: Can you please move the repeater as advised to the other rooms

If the issue remains try the other repeater that was already in the apartment then that would let us know if the new repeater is at fault

If the issue remains then I will speak with the management company on Monday to see what is best way of addressing the issue 
There was 6 people studying full time since March and also some had part time jobs online
They had no issues as I checked with them in August 
The nay also be some local issue as there was  works being done by eir the network supplier for Internet in Ireland in Cork due to a storm in August. 
I don't think all that work is completed yet, it may or may not be a factor. 
Let me know how moving location works
19/09/20, 7:47 pm - Siobhan: Did u press 111
Send photo
19/09/20, 7:48 pm - Siobhan: Don't worry the electricity will not cut off at weekend
19/09/20, 7:55 pm - Aman: <Media omitted>
19/09/20, 7:59 pm - Siobhan: You have ‚Ç¨27.39
You are OK for electricity 
So all credit went on
Is light flashing or what type of alarm is there?
19/09/20, 7:59 pm - Aman: It's was a alarm ...bee bee sound
19/09/20, 8:01 pm - Siobhan: Is it still going
19/09/20, 8:04 pm - Aman: No
19/09/20, 8:04 pm - Aman: It's happened only once
19/09/20, 8:04 pm - Aman: Now it's not making any sound.
19/09/20, 8:05 pm - Siobhan: OK there is adequate credit
19/09/20, 8:05 pm - Aman: We were unable to sense it. üëç
19/09/20, 8:06 pm - Siobhan: I will share info on the meter
It is called the classic meter
19/09/20, 8:07 pm - Siobhan: https://www.prepaypower.ie/support/topping-up
19/09/20, 8:07 pm - Aman: And one more siobhan, Premtom said, that we either need to have a door in washroom or the curtains length should be  increased in washroom. Because once a person takes a bath the whole washroom is wet and it doesn't dry.
19/09/20, 8:09 pm - Siobhan: The curtains can be made longer with link
In Ireland there a bathmats that you put on the floor they are thicker and a lot more absorbant than towels
19/09/20, 8:10 pm - Aman: No the length can't be increased
19/09/20, 8:10 pm - Aman: <Media omitted>
19/09/20, 8:11 pm - Aman: <Media omitted>
19/09/20, 8:11 pm - Aman: This is a huge gap
19/09/20, 8:12 pm - Siobhan: Yes I know the links go on the top and increase the length
19/09/20, 8:17 pm - Jay: <Media omitted>
19/09/20, 9:09 pm - Siobhan: Yes Premton and I discussed the door he is replacing the runners that the door slides on so it will slide easily to open and close
20/09/20, 3:05 pm - Siobhan: There should be no problem sleeping in the big room because of the crack in the glass while we are waiting for it to be replaced as there is double glazed window
20/09/20, 3:12 pm - Mayur: Sure Siobhan
20/09/20, 3:12 pm - Siobhan: Don't worry it will be fixed
20/09/20, 3:12 pm - Mayur: Please try to get the showers fixed in the rooms soon because as of now we have only one working shower amongst the five of us. üòÖ
20/09/20, 3:15 pm - Aman: Meena is covering all heavy clothes, at night cold air is coming inside. Day is fine. Night is difficult for her.
20/09/20, 3:37 pm - Meena: Yes Siobhan..kindly arrange..
20/09/20, 4:58 pm - Siobhan: That is already done
20/09/20, 5:40 pm - Meena: <Media omitted>
20/09/20, 5:40 pm - Meena: <Media omitted>
20/09/20, 7:17 pm - Siobhan: As advised we have arranged for the window to be looked at. Is the window closed fully? 
There are vents also on the window
They are required to assist with ventilation which is very important in Ireland due to our damp weather in if too much heat or not enough heat is used along with the condensation we get then dampness occurs.
You will sometimes find condensation(wet) on glass inside bedroom windows in winter
This is totally normal here it is due to our climate
It is important to open windows daily for a little while to allow the exchange of the air in our climate throughout the year otherwise it results in dampness
The blinds are also a form of heat control for us as when closed they are a form of insulation
When investing in bedding the duvets (quilts) come in a thing called togs the higher the tog the warmer they are.
20/09/20, 7:20 pm - Siobhan: https://images.app.goo.gl/KEvtgFgg4qCg6FZR9
20/09/20, 7:34 pm - Siobhan: The above explains duvet togs
Usually in our house I use @9 tog from @ mid March to end of October
Then I use a @ 13tog duvet for the winter. If the weather is very cold I use both together. 
We also use fleece blankets / throws both on the bed in winter and also over us watching TV in winter as it can be cold. I feel the cold even though I have lived here all my life. The weather here really never gets awfully warm and the duvet is used most of the summer unless on a very rare warm night and a sheet may be enough. To be honest I can't remember it being that hot for a few summers. 
The temperature never really gets really hot or extremely cold in comparison to other countries. 
Snow fall is usually very light it may last a week or so or some winter we have none. The  same today was a roasting day in Ireland the early 20s is hot here.
From March onwards until mid October usually we would not use any form of heating. The heating usage increase and December and January is usually the coldest.
I will send you on pictures of what I talk about so it will be easier than my description

You place them outside your bath or shower and you stand on the when you are drying your self

20/09/20, 7:50 pm - Siobhan: This will contain a beanbag you put in the beanbag to the microwave for the correct time then put it inside the owl as the beanbag is really hot
You put in the bed

There are also things called hot water bottles
They are rubber and you fill them with hot water and place them in the bed and put the bedclothes over it

Before you get into bed you take the hot water bottle out of the bed incase it would leak or burst and cause burns
20/09/20, 7:56 pm - Siobhan: Penneys is usually the cheapest with clothes they sell fleece pyjamas and onesies and fleece socks.
They also sell duvets warmers etc
It is very popular in Ireland and it is known as Primark in the UK 
They sell lots of modern clothes very cheap 
Dunnes stores is usually a little dearer but the quality is usually better 
Guineys also good for bedding 
Even with heat on it can be cold at night. 
Because of the coast it keeps things cooler
